<h2>How to set up Minecraft Dungeons for modding (Microsoft Store/PC Game Pass version)</h2><ol><li><p>If your PC has multiple drives and you're not sure where Dungeons is installed, you need to first find that out. Here are three ways of finding it:</p></li><ul><li><p>If you have the Minecraft Launcher installed, simply open the launcher and go to the Dungeons page on the left, then go to the Installation tab at the top. This page should tell you where the game is installed.</p></li><li><p>If you have the Xbox app installed, open the app, find Dungeons in the Installed games list on the left, then click the button with the three dots and choose Manage. In the window that pops up, go to the FILES tab and it should show where it is installed under Installation info.</p></li><li><p>If you don't have either installed, you can go to each drive and check if it has the <code>XboxGames\Minecraft Dungeons</code> folder.</p></li></ul><li><p>Once you know what drive the game is installed on, go to that drive in File Explorer, and then to <code>XboxGames\Minecraft Dungeons\Content\Dungeons\Content\Paks</code></p></li><li><p>Create a new folder here called <code>~mods</code> (Yes, with a <code>~</code>) and put your mods in this new folder.</p></li></ol><br/><hr/><br/><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><ul><li><p>If you're not able to move files from a different drive to the <code>~mods</code> folder, try first moving them to the same drive as the game, and then moving them to the <code>~mods</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>If it says you don't have permission to move files to the <code>~mods</code> folder, make sure the game is closed before moving the files, and if the files already exist in the <code>~mods</code> folder, try deleting those before moving the replacements.</p></li><li><p>If you don't have the <code>XboxGames\Minecraft Dungeons</code> folder, you might be missing a Windows update or an Xbox app update, or you installed the game before getting the update that started using this folder. To fix this, try uninstalling the game completely and then installing it again from the Xbox app or Minecraft Launcher.</p></li><ul><li><p>If it still doesn't create that folder, check the Microsoft Store for updates to the Xbox app, and check Settings for Windows updates. Once everything is updated, try reinstalling the game again.</p></li><li><p>If it <i>still</i> doesn't create that folder, things get a lot more complicated, check the Legacy Guide below.</p></li></ul></ul><details><summary>Legacy Guide - <span class="warning">Do not use this unless everything above fails</span></summary><h3>Prerequisites</h3><ul><li><p>Temporarily disable any antivirus software. Most will detect that an unknown script is being run and try to stop it.</p></li><li><p>If you use Bitdefender, you need to uninstall it before continuing, as it breaks the script even when turned off.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you have at least 10 GBs of space free.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your game is up to date. To do this, press Win + R, enter <code>ms-windows-store://DownloadsAndUpdates/</code> and press enter. Then, press "Get updates" in the top right corner of the window that opens.</p></li><li><p>Install <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Visual C++ Redist</a>. Even if you think you have it installed, try the installer. You may have an older version that won't work.</p></li></ul><h3>Setup</h3><ol><li><p>Click the Windows icon in the bottom left corner and enter <code>powershell</code> then click "<span class="warning">Run as Administrator</span>"</p></li><li><p>Paste this command into PowerShell and press enter:<div class="row"><div class="button inline sp-mcd-win-store-copy-button">Copy Command</div><div class="sp-mcd-win-store-command inline" style="max-width: 600px;overflow-x:auto;"></div></div></p></li><li><p>It might ask you about an "Execution Policy Change" - Just press A and then Enter. In some languages, the key you need to press might be different. It should be the one next to "Yes to all".</p></li><li><p>You will be asked to select a folder. Choose an empty folder where you want the game to be moved to. Do not choose a folder in Documents, Desktop, Program Files or One Drive, it will break things.</p></li></ol><p class="warning"><b>The game will open at one point. Do not close it when this happens. If you run into any issues, make sure to check the Troubleshooting section below.</b></p><ol start="5"><li><p>A <code>~mods</code> folder will appear. This is where you place your mods.</p></li><li><p>Launching the modded game is just like launching the regular game. You can do it from the start menu, Windows Store, Xbox app, and so on, just like you normally do. Do <b>NOT</b> try to launch it by running the .exe files in the game folder.</p></li></ol><br/><br/><hr/><br/><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><p>If you run into any issues while/after patching the game, some of these things might help you.</p><ul><li><p>If the game didn't open at all while patching and the patching didn't work, try opening the game manually before running the patcher. Keep the game open until it either closes by itself or the patcher finishes.</p></li><li><p>If you get an error saying it can't verify your ownership of the game, you must have launched the game using the .exe file. Don't do that. Run the game from the start menu, Windows Store, or Xbox app. If you did, but still get this error, reinstall the regular game and log in at least once (open the game and select a character) before patching it.</p></li></ul></details><script>{
