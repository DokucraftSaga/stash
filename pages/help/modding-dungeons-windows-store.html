<h2>How to set up Minecraft Dungeons for modding (Windows Store version)</h2><p>The Windows Store version of Minecraft Dungeons normally won't let you modify its files/folders. To get around this issue, follow these steps:</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><ul><li><p>Temporarily disable any antivirus software. Most will detect that an unknown script is being run and try to stop it.</p></li><li><p>If you use Bitdefender, you need to uninstall it before continuing, as it breaks the script even when turned off.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you have at least 10 GBs of space free.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your game is up to date. To do this, press Win + R, enter <code>ms-windows-store://DownloadsAndUpdates/</code> and press enter. Then, press "Get updates" in the top right corner of the window that opens.</p></li><li><p>Install <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Visual C++ Redist</a>. Even if you think you have it installed, try the installer. You may have an older version that won't work.</p></li></ul><h3>Setup</h3><ol><li><p>Click the Windows icon in the bottom left corner and enter <code>powershell</code> then click "<span class="warning">Run as Administrator</span>"</p></li><li><p>Paste this command into PowerShell and press enter:<div class="row"><div class="button inline sp-mcd-win-store-copy-button">Copy Command</div><div class="sp-mcd-win-store-command inline" style="max-width: 600px;overflow-x:auto;"></div></div></p></li><li><p>It will ask you about an "Execution Policy Change" - Just press A and then Enter. In some languages, the key you need to press might be different. It should be the one next to "Yes to all".</p></li></ol><p class="warning"><b>The game will open at one point. Do not close it when this happens.</b></p><ol start="4"><li><p>After a while, you will be asked to select a folder. This is the new installation folder for the modded game. Do not choose a folder in Program Files, it will break things.</p></li><li><p>A <code>~mods</code> folder will appear. This is where you place your mods.</p></li><li><p>To launch the modded version of the game, press the Windows icon in the bottom left corner and look for <code>Minecraft Dungeons [Modding]</code></p></li></ol><p><b class="warning">Warning: </b>When activating Developer Mode with the script, it might be required to reboot. If you encounter an error, try to reboot and run the script again and see if that fixes the issue.</p><script>const MCD_WIN_STORE_CMD = 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass;mkdir C:\\mcdtemp; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://docs.dungeonsworkshop.net/installscript/installscript.ps1" -OutFile C:\\mcdtemp\\winstore.ps1; C:\\mcdtemp\\winstore.ps1'
