<h2>How to set up Minecraft Dungeons for modding (Windows Store version)</h2><p>The Windows Store version of Minecraft Dungeons normally won't let you modify its files/folders. To get around this issue, follow these steps:</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><ul><li><p>Temporarily disable any antivirus software. Most will detect that an unknown script is being run and try to stop it.</p></li><li><p>If you use Bitdefender, you need to uninstall it before continuing, as it breaks the script even when turned off.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you have at least 10 GBs of space free.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your game is up to date. To do this, press Win + R, enter <code>ms-windows-store://DownloadsAndUpdates/</code> and press enter. Then, press "Get updates" in the top right corner of the window that opens.</p></li><li><p>Install <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Visual C++ Redist</a>. Even if you think you have it installed, try the installer. You may have an older version that won't work.</p></li></ul><h3>Setup</h3><ol><li><p>Download <a href="https://docs.dungeonsworkshop.net/installscript/storepatcher.exe">this patcher</a> and run it.</p></li></ol><p class="warning"><b>The game will open at one point. Do not close it when this happens.</b></p><ol start="2"><li><p>After a while, you will be asked to select a folder. This is the new installation folder for the modded game. Do not choose a folder in Program Files or One Drive, it will break things.</p></li><li><p>A <code>~mods</code> folder will appear. This is where you place your mods.</p></li><li><p>To launch the modded version of the game, press the Windows icon in the bottom left corner and look for <code>Minecraft Dungeons [Modding]</code></p></li><li><p>If everything seems to work fine, you won't need the patcher anymore, so you can delete it if you want to.</p></li></ol><br/><br/><hr/><br/><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><p>If you run into any issues while/after patching the game, some of these things might help you.</p><ul><li><p>If the game didn't open at all while patching and the patching didn't work, try opening the game manually before running the patcher. Keep the game open until it either closes by itself or the patcher finishes.</p></li><li><p>If you get an error saying it can't verify your ownership of the game, you must have launched the game using the .exe file. Don't do that. Run the game from the start menu, like the setup steps above says.</p></li><li><p>If you downloaded the patcher a while ago and it doesn't seem to work correctly anymore, something might have changed and you need a newer version. Just redownload the patcher and try again.</p></li></ul><br/><h3>Updating</h3><p>When a new game update is released, the modded version can't be updated through the Windows Store like the normal game. Instead, follow these steps to update:</p><ol><li><p>Download <a href="https://docs.dungeonsworkshop.net/installscript/storepatcher.exe">this patcher</a> and go to the folder you downloaded it to.</p></li><li><p><b>Shift + Right Click</b> in the folder and select "<b>Open command window here</b>" or "<b>Open Powershell window here</b>".</p></li><li><p>In the window that opens, run this command:<div class="row"><div class="button inline sp-mcd-win-store-copy-button">Copy Command</div><div class="sp-mcd-win-store-command inline" style="max-width: 600px;overflow-x:auto;"></div></div></p></li></ol><p class="warning"><b>The game will open at one point. Do not close it when this happens.</b></p><ol start="4"><li><p>After a while, you will be asked to select a folder. This is the new installation folder for the modded game. Do not choose a folder in Program Files or One Drive, it will break things.</p></li></ol><script>const MCD_WIN_STORE_CMD = 'storepatcher.exe update'
