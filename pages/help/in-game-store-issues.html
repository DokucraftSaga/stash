<h2>Why Dokucraft Is Not on the In-Game Marketplace</h2><p>The Bedrock edition of Minecraft uses an in-game store to distribute resource packs that makes the installation easy. However, Dokucraft: The Saga Continues cannot be added to it. Below are the two main reasons as to why it can't.</p><h3>1. Microsoft's Criteria</h3><p>Putting a resource pack on the in-game marketplace requires the developer of the pack to be a <i>Minecraft Partner </i>. You can read about what that means and how to become one on <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft">Microsoft's page about it. </a>One of the criteria mentioned on that page for becoming a partner is this:</p><p class="center"><img src="/resources/docs/criteria.png"/></p><p>This is where the problems are. Dokucraft TSC is a community driven project that anyone can contribute to. While there are some individuals that manage the packs, the website, the stash, the Discord server, and so on, there is no "team" or business behind the pack. There certainly isn't anything registered or <i>official </i>enough to meet that criterion.</p><h3>2. Legal Issues</h3><p>There is no official license anyone who wants to contribute has to agree with other than <i>"the textures may be used in the pack."</i></p><p>That is extremely vague, and because of this, each contributor decides how their textures can be used or distributed. Some contributors has said in the past that they don't wish to have their textures distributed on consoles. You may ask "why don't we just replace the textures they made?" and, well, it's complicated.</p><p>While the stash is an attempt to credit each contributor properly, it's impossible to say what derives from what for all of the textures and the license of derivative works is up to each contributor. Because of how late into the project the stash was created and how it used to work before the manual submission process was implemented, older textures may also be credited incorrectly in some rare cases.</p><p><b>To put it simply, there's no way to know exactly what the license is for every texture used in the pack, and it's too late to enforce one without starting over from scratch and creating an entirely new pack.</b></p><p>Without knowing exactly what each texture can be used for, other than putting it in a pack and releasing it like we always have, we technically cannot legally distribute the pack differently and we can certainly not put a price on the pack and make money from it.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>We know lot of people wants Dokucraft on the in-game marketplace, we're asked constantly about a version for consoles, there is just no way it can be added and it's too late for anyone to do anything about it. On some platforms, like <a href="?help=xbox-installation" onclick="stash.page.load(&quot;?help=xbox-installation&quot;, null, event)">Xbox</a>, it's still possible to install Dokucraft without having it on the marketplace.</p>
