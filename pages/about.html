<h2>About</h2><p>DokuStash is mainly a collection of Dokucraft TSC assets, but also offers some useful tools to help maintain the packs. The stash makes it easier to find assets that has been made for the project by allowing you to filter them by various properties and share the results.</p><h2>Adding to the collection</h2><p>Anyone can submit files to the stash from the 'More' menu at the top of this page. Submitted files will be manually reviewed before being added to the stash.</p><p>Before December 2017, all textures posted in the Dokucraft TSC forum thread were added (mostly) automatically to the stash, but that system was dropped in favor of the new file submission system to make the stash easier to maintain.</p><h2>File names</h2><p>File names follow the format: <code>&lt;Contributor Name&gt;_&lt;ID&gt;.&lt;Ext&gt;</code>, for example <code>CCCode_17590.png</code></p><p>The ID is a number that is unique to that file. IDs are based on the number of files in the stash before it, which means that the lower the ID is, the earlier it was added.</p><h2>Statistics</h2><script>stash.page.identifier().then(e=>{e.append(stash.chart.timeline(stash.files,{title:"Number of files over time",dataHandler:(e,t)=>e.map(e=>t[e].length).reduce((e,t)=>e.push((e.length&&e[e.length-1]||0)+t)&&e,[])},{title:"Files added per quarter",dataHandler:(e,t)=>e.map(e=>t[e].length)},{title:"Number of contributors",dataHandler:(e,t)=>e.map(e=>t[e].reduce((e,t)=>e.add(stash.data[t].contributor),new Set)).map((e,t,a)=>a.slice(0,t+1).reduce((e,t)=>(t.forEach(t=>e.add(t)),e),new Set).size)},{title:"Active contributors per quarter",dataHandler:(e,t)=>e.map(e=>t[e].reduce((e,t)=>e.add(stash.data[t].contributor),new Set).size)}))});</script><img onload="stash.page.identifierLoaded(this);void(0);" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=="/>
